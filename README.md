- Hi, I’m @x86-waffles, a uni student pursuing a CS degree
- I’m interested in philosophy, politics, social psychology, guitar, video gaming, and learning new programming languages and techniques.
- I’m currently learning Python basics for Data Science, Machine Learning, and Web Development. I'm also learning HTML5/CSS, JS, and Windows PowerShell.
- I’m looking to collaborate on reinforcement learning projects with a focus on recreating/enhancing the discontinued Technical Machine project.
- Fun fact: I own copies of Pokemon HeartGold and Pokemon SoulSilver in every originally-manufactured language and region code.
